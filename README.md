# miq library

Lightweight jQuery-like DOM library.

Miq is like jQuery, but with fewer functions and more modern and therefore only 1 kilobyte zipped.

Miq compared to jQuery:

* No seldom used functions.
* Leaving animation functions to CSS transitions.
* AJAX function uses modern Promise (or polyfill).
* Inherits all powerful functions from Array like forEach, map and filter.
* With only 1kb zipped extremely small.

See the [miq homepage](http://www.bitstorm.org/javascript/miq/) for more information.
